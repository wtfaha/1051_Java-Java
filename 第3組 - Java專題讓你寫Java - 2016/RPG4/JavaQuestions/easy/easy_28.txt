Given:

11. class Converter{
12.     public static void main(String[] args){
13.         Integer i = args[0];
14.         int j = 12;
15.         System.out.println("It is " + (j==i) + " that j==i.");
16.     }
17. }

What is the result when the programmer attempts to compile the code and run it with the command

java Converter 12?

	A. It is true that j==i.
	B. Compilation fails because of an error in line 13
	C. An exception is thrown at runtime.
	D. It is false that j==i.
